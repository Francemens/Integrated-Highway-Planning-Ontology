# Background
State highway agencies (SHAs) have multiple functional groups responsible for safety, maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R), and mobility planning. This can lead to a siloed approach to planning. This problem is reinforced by functional groups employing incompatible legacy systems. This can result in redundant planning efforts and potential spatial-temporal conflicts in the projects proposed by the different groups over a planning period. Accordingly, there is a need for an integrated approach towards the cross-functional planning of highway projects.


# Purpose
The aim of this ontology is to provide a shared link between information silos of different functional groups in highway agencies to support efficient planning of highway projects. Integrated Highway Planning Ontology (IHP-Onto) is a formal knowledge representation of highway assets, M&amp;R planning, and inter-project coordination information.

# Potential Applications
•	This ontology can enable the use of a common vocabulary among functional groups working on the same asset network but sharing common information requirements of such networks.
•	It can also support an iterative approach to updating changes in asset information, planning decisions and constraints, and inter-project coordination information.
•	IHP-Onto can also be used to characterize and document a structured approach to resolving spatial-temporal conflicts in a proposed highway projects program.
•	For highway agencies transitioning to the development of interconnected systems, relevant information items to be collected by the agency can also be extracted from this ontology.
